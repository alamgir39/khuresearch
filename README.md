All research data about Video Stability Assessment Metric

You will find our method calculated mean displacement error and associated mean opinion score (MOS). The personal MOS scanned files are stored in the directory named “Scanned_Persional_MOS”. 

Our method result will be find in “Experimantal Result for Category_name/OUR_ Category_name Collection/”. For example, Experimantal Result for Quick Rotation/OUR_Roation Collection/. The result i displays mean displacement error (MDE) for frame by frame and finally average MDE is estimated for each video of each category.

Information about video displaying for MOS collection is include in “instruction for video display sequence.txt”

The “Subjective Assessment Form.pdf” is the assessment form that is used for MOS.

Executable file for “Video Stability Assessment Metric” will be uploaded soon. Thank you.
